        <h2>SCALE- AND RHYTHM-AWARE MUSICAL NOTE ESTIMATION FOR
          VOCAL F0 TRAJECTORIES BASED ON A SEMI-TATUM-SYNCHRONOUS
          HIERARCHICAL HIDDEN SEMI-MARKOV MODEL</h2>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          This paper presents a statistical method
          that estimates a musically-natural sequence of musical notes
          from a vocal F0 trajectory.
          Since the onset times and F0s of sung notes are considerably deviated
          from the tatums and pitches indicated in a musical score,
          a score model is crucial for improving time-frequency quantization of F0s.
          We therefore propose a hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM)
          that combines a score model representing the rhythms and pitches of musical notes under musical scales
          with an F0 model representing the time-frequency deviations of F0s from the score.
          In the score model,
          musical scales are generated stochastically and
          note pitches are then generated according to the scales.
          To make rhythms,
          note onsets follow a Markov process defined on the tatum grid.
          In the F0 model,
          onset time deviations, smooth inter-note F0 transitions, and F0 fluctuations
          are added to the score stochastically.
          Given an F0 trajectory,
          we estimate the most likely sequence of musical notes
          while giving more importance on the score model than the F0 model.
          Experimental results showed that
          the proposed method outperformed an HMM-based method having no models of scales and rhythms.
